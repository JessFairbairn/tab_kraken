# Tab Kraken

## Development
### Build
Use the build.cmd (Windows) or build.sh (Bash) scripts to build. I've really kept it simple, no bundlers or anything.

### Tests
Currently using Karma, I'm looking to change as Karma is a defunct project and doesn't play nicely with Github Workflows but that is not a priority.
